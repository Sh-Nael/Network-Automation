By this tool you can Convert your IPv4 to IPv6 automatically (thanks to IP addressing python library).
All you need to do is Copy your IPv4 addresses in the "IPv4_addresses" column in the IPv4.xls and run the script.
The system will create a new excel file named: "result.xls" and put both original IPv4 and converted IPv6 in that file.
