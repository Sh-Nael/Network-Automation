By this tool you can Convert your IPv4 to IPv6 automatically (thanks to IP addressing python library).<br>
All you need to do is Copy your IPv4 list in the <b>"IPv4_addresses"</b> column in the IPv4.xls file and <b>run the script.</b><br>
The system will create a new excel file named: "result.xls" and put both original IPv4 and converted IPv6 in that file.<br>
<b>Important: In this case we wanted to have DNS64 address format, So you may change the string part of the code to the IPv6 format you are looking for.</b><br>
Have fun.
