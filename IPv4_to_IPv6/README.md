By this tool you can Convert your IPv4 to IPv6 automatically (thanks to IP addressing python library).<br>
All you need to do is Copy your IPv4 addresses in the <b>"IPv4_addresses"</b> column in the IPv4.xls file and run the script.<br>
The system will create a new excel file named: "result.xls" and put both original IPv4 and converted IPv6 in that file.<br>
